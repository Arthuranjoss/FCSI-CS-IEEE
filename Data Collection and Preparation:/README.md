# Introduction:
This guide presents the steps for collecting data sets for training and developing the FCSI model of the IEEE Artificial Intelligence activity. This material will be reviewed and used for teaching purposes and will serve as a basis for project members to map activities.
Every Computer Vision project starts with a data collection and dataset creation strategy. In recent years, people have focused on developing models without investing as much as necessary in creating training data. In fact, creating an image dataset was really complicated and time-consuming, and often done by engineers or interns in a very inefficient way. Despite the existence of labeling tools and open source tools, unfortunately, many companies still face issues with the performance of their AI models.

Most of these issues come from the quality of the dataset itself by the amount of data in the dataset, the amount of mislabeled data in your dataset, or relevance of the images within the dataset.

# 1-Where to find a dataset?
Finding the right data is crucial to training a successful computer vision model for segmentation and classification. Here's how to navigate this process:
- Data sources:

  - Public datasets: Several public datasets are available online designed specifically for computer vision tasks. Popular repositories include:

  - ImageNet: A huge image database with millions of labeled images.

  - CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100: Standard datasets for image classification containing images labeled into multiple categories.

  - Pascal VOC and COCO: Large datasets for object detection and segmentation with labeled bounding boxes and pixel annotations.

  - Google Datasets: https://datasetsearch.research.google.com/ is a Google Cloud Platform service that offers a variety of datasets, including some designed specifically for computer vision tasks. You can search datasets based on keywords like “image segmentation” or “image classification” to find relevant options.

  - Microsoft Azure: https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/open-datasets Microsoft Azure also provides a collection of open datasets through its cloud platform. Similar to Google datasets, you can search for datasets that meet your computer vision needs.

Deep Learning Frameworks:



TensorFlow https://www.tensorflow.org/: A powerful open source framework from Google, widely used for deep learning tasks. TensorFlow offers resources and tutorials for building computer vision models, including functionality for image segmentation and classification.

PyTorch pytorch.org: Another open source deep learning framework that is gaining significant traction. PyTorch provides tools and libraries designed specifically for computer vision tasks. It is known for its flexibility and ease of use.

Code and Articles:

Finding code examples and research articles related to your project is crucial. Here are some tips:

GitHub Repositories: Several public repositories on GitHub feature computer vision projects with code implementations. Search terms like “TensorFlow image segmentation” or “PyTorch image classification” to find relevant projects.

Domain Specific Repositories: Depending on your specific application, there may be repositories that suit your niche. For example, in medical imaging, there are datasets for tasks such as cell segmentation or tumor classification. Searching for "image dataset [your domain]" can help you find relevant sources.

arXiv: arxiv.org is an online archive for preprints in various fields, including computer vision. You can search recent research articles on image segmentation or classification techniques to stay up to date with advances in the field.

Keep in mind that the best choice between these frameworks (TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch) depends on your specific needs and preferences. Both offer excellent capabilities for computer vision tasks.

By combining these features, you can effectively find data, choose the right framework, and leverage existing code and research to build and train your computer vision model for segmentation and classification.

2-What are the Criteria?

Data selection criteria:

Relevance: The data must be directly related to the objects or scenes that you want your model to segment and classify. The use of set
