#1-Data Collection and Preparation:

Next, we will proceed to collect a suitable set of data (Datasets) to train and validate the model. The images will be labeled for classification and segmentation purposes, and will go through a pre-processing process for resizing, normalization and data augmentation.
MS COCO (Microsoft Common Objects in Context)
SOL (Unde Scene standing)
ImageNet
MNIST
CIFAR-10
CIFAR-100
STL-10.

#2-Model Development: 
We will use the TensorFlow library to develop the AI ​​model. We opted for a modular architecture, with separate modules for pre-processing, feature extraction, classification, segmentation and post-processing. For feature extraction, we use a pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN), ResNet, and for segmentation, we implement a U-Net architecture.

#3-Model Training and Validation:
Considering time and computational resource constraints, we will adopt an Incremental Learning training approach. This strategy allows you to train the model in stages, starting with a smaller set of data and gradually updating it with new data as it becomes available. to speed up the training process. We will also use transfer learning techniques to reuse pre-trained weights and tune the model's hyperparameters to optimize performance. The training process will be validated on a separate validation dataset to evaluate the accuracy and generalization of the model. The training period will be between 2-4 months.

#4-Final Tests: 
During this stage, the final verification of the complete solution developed will be carried out, ensuring that the solution as a whole is working correctly and meets the requirements and expectations previously defined. This includes testing the integration between the different components of the solution, verifying that the user interface is working as expected, ensuring that all functional and non-functional requirements have been met, and identifying and fixing any defects or issues that may affect usability or the quality of the solution.

#5-Model Launch: 
This step involves deploying the trained and validated model, along with other solution components, into an operational environment where end users can access and use it to perform specific tasks
